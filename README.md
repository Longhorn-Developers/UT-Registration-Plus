**UT Registration Plus (UTRP)** streamlines the process of registering for classes at UT Austin by reducing the chaos of juggling multiple tabs like Rate My Professor, Google Sheets, and the UT Course Schedule. With UTRP, you can simplify class selection and schedule management. We've all been there. 20 tabs of Rate My Professor, Google Spreadsheet, and the UT Course Schedule open and you still don't know what classes to take. UT Registration Plus (UTRP), tries to streamline most of the unnecessary steps and headaches of registering for classes at UT Austin.

## Demo

## Features

-   **Quick Access to Class Info**: For each class in the UT Course Schedule, UTRP provides a "breakdown" popup with direct links to RateMyProfessor, Course Evaluation Surveys (CES), and past syllabi.
-   **Prerequisite & Restriction Highlights**: Displays course descriptions with highlighted details on prerequisites, restrictions, and other important info.
-   **Grade Distribution Graphs**: View an aggregate and semester-specific graph of grade distributions for each course.
-   **Saved Courses List**: Easily add courses to a list and view them in the extension popup. Copy unique numbers with a single click.
-   **Conflict Detection**: Automatically highlights and strikes out courses that conflict with your saved courses in the UT Course Catalog.
-   **Weekly Schedule View**: Displays your saved courses in a weekly schedule format for easier planning.
-   **Multiple Schedule Support**: Create multiple schedules to plan for different registration scenarios.
-   **And much more!**

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Registration-Plus.git`
2. **Node Version**: This project requires the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage the correct version:
    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```
    _Note: Installing the wrong Node version can lead to errors during setup._
3. Install dependencies using `pnpm` (which manages and patches dependencies):
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

Once set up, the extension can be built to the `dist/` directory using the following methods:

### Development Builds

-   Run the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

> **Note**: Injected content on UT pages may not display correctly in development mode. To develop with accurate styles, use the following command:
>
> ```bash
> NODE_ENV='development' pnpm run dev build --mode development -w
> ```

### Production Builds

-   To generate production builds:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

<details>
<summary>Beta Builds</summary>

Use `BETA=true pnpm build` to generate a beta build.

</details>

### Docker

This project includes a Dockerfile that allows you to build, zip, or run the extension in development mode using Docker. Follow these instructions to get started.

#### Prerequisites

-   Docker installed on your machine
-   Git (to clone the repository)

#### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Registration-Plus.git
    cd UT-Registration-Plus
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t ut-registration-plus .
    ```

### Using Docker for Different Modes

The Docker setup supports three modes of operation: build, zip, and dev. You can choose the mode either by passing it as a command or by setting the `BUILD_MODE` environment variable.

#### Build Mode (Default)

This mode builds the extension and places the output in the `dist` folder.

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/extension/dist ut-registration-plus build
```

or

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/extension/dist -e BUILD_MODE=build ut-registration-plus
```

#### Zip Mode

This mode builds the extension and creates a zipped package in the `package` folder.

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/package:/extension/package ut-registration-plus zip
```

or

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/package:/extension/package -e BUILD_MODE=zip ut-registration-plus
```

#### Development Mode with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

This mode runs the extension in development mode with HMR support.

_Note_: This currently doesn't work.

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/extension/dist -v $(pwd)/dist:/extension/dist -p 5173:5173 ut-registration-plus dev
```

or

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/dist:/extension/dist -p 5173:5173 -e BUILD_MODE=dev ut-registration-plus
```

#### Accessing the Built Extension

-   For build mode, the extension files will be in the `dist` directory on your host machine.
-   For zip mode, the zipped extension will be in the `package` directory on your host machine.
-   For dev mode, the extension will be continuously built in the `dist` directory, and you can load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

#### Docker Development Workflow

When working on the extension:

1. Run the container in dev mode
2. Make changes to your source code
3. The extension will automatically rebuild thanks to HMR
4. Reload the extension in Chrome to see your changes

#### Troubleshooting

-   If you encounter permission issues with the output directories, ensure that the directories exist on your host machine and have the correct permissions.
-   For any other issues, please check the Docker logs or open an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Loading the Extension Manually

To load the extension manually in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable 'Developer Mode'.
3. Click 'Load unpacked'.
4. Navigate to the `dist/` directory and select it.

## Bug Reporting

If you encounter bugs or issues, please report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Registration-Plus/issues) section, including:

-   A clear, descriptive title
-   Steps to reproduce the issue
-   Expected behavior
-   Screenshots or logs (if applicable)

We aim to address issues promptly.

## Conventional Commits & Branch Naming Convention

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification for commit messages. This ensures a consistent commit history and enables automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Messages

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Where:

-   **type**: One of the following:
    -   `feat`: A new feature
    -   `fix`: A bug fix
    -   `docs`: Documentation updates
    -   `style`: Code formatting changes (whitespace, semicolons, etc.)
    -   `refactor`: Code restructuring (without adding features or fixing bugs)
    -   `test`: Adding or modifying tests
    -   `chore`: Maintenance tasks or build process changes

Example:

```
feat(auth): add login functionality
fix(ui): align buttons in navbar
```

### Branch Naming
