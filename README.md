**UT Registration Plus (UTRP)** streamlines the process of registering for classes at UT Austin by reducing the chaos of juggling multiple tabs like Rate My Professor, Google Sheets, and the UT Course Schedule. With UTRP, you can simplify class selection and schedule management. We've all been there. 20 tabs of Rate My Professor, Google Spreadsheet, and the UT Course Schedule open and you still don't know what classes to take. 

## Demo

## Features

-   **Quick Access to Class Info**: For each class in the UT Course Schedule, UTRP provides a "breakdown" popup with direct links to RateMyProfessor, Course Evaluation Surveys (CES), and past syllabi.
-   **Prerequisite & Restriction Highlights**: Displays course descriptions with highlighted details on prerequisites, restrictions, and other important info.
-   **Grade Distribution Graphs**: View an aggregate and semester-specific graph of grade distributions for each course.
-   **Saved Courses List**: Easily add courses to a list and view them in the extension popup. Copy unique numbers with a single click.
-   **Conflict Detection**: Automatically highlights and strikes out courses that conflict with your saved courses in the UT Course Catalog.
-   **Weekly Schedule View**: Displays your saved courses in a weekly schedule format for easier planning.
-   **Multiple Schedule Support**: Create multiple schedules to plan for different registration scenarios.
-   **And much more!**
