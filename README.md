We've all been there. 20 tabs of Rate My Professor, Google Spreadsheet, and the UT Course Schedule open and you still don't know what classes to take.
This extension, UT Registration Plus (UTRP), tries to streamline most of the unnecessary steps and headaches of registering for classes at UT Austin.

- For each class in the UT Course Schedule site, UTRP provides a "breakdown" popup, with quick and easy links to the instructor's RateMyProfessor, Course Evaluation Survey (CES) and past syllabi.

- Shows the course description with highlighted information on prerequisites, restrictions, etc.

- Shows an aggregate and semesterly graph of the grade distributions for each course.

- Gives you the ability to add "Add Course" and view them in the extension popup, a quick list of all the courses you have saved and an easy way to copy unique numbers.

- Highlights and crosses-out what courses on the UT Course Catalog would conflict with your currently saved courses, making selecting courses that fit with your schedule so much easier.

- Display's a weekly schedule based on your saved courses.

- Give you the ability to create multiple schedules to plan for different scenarios.

- ... and much more!
